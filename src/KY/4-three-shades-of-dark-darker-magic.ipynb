Iterative feature engineering seems to be the key in this competition.  \n","\n","* Shifted sales and rolling mean on those shifted sales are very important features. \n","\n","* But when calculating shifted sales for lags under 28, you'll find some NA values in prediction part. The idea is to keep those features and calculate the missing values with your prediction by row.\n","\n","**Question) I'm wondering how you didn't face overfitting? Adding a lag_1 feature increased my local score a lot, which resulted in 0.6+ LB score - obviously overfitting**\n","\n","**Ans 1)** Hello, if you check top public kernels they don't use lag_1. If you use recent demand values, for example lag_1 the model will give high importance to that feature. Then if you are using predictions to make other predictions from period t1 to t28, each time you predict you will increase the error of the prediction. In the public notebooks they use rolling windows and don't use close lags. You can still overfit heavily. I believe that this technique should only be applied if you have a really good cv strategy, loss function and evaluation metric, then you can measure if the technique is good or overfits. \n","\n","**Ans 2)** This was an example to show the idea behind iterative prediction. I don't use lags under 7 in my model. If you use recent demand values, the model will predict almost the same values for the next 28 days. And lag_1 seems to be the worst one to be added.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"jLJ7Hqo6o6VK","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1593535452795,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":4651775,"user":{"displayName":"Abhishek
